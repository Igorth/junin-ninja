# Junin-ninja
Unity Game

## Description

Junin Ninja is a dodge gaming that you need to avoid being touched by the 
raining cats.

The purpose of this game is to understand the principles of Unity and C#.

What I learned during this process was:
- Slicing Sprites;
- Animate components;
- Gravity and Collisions;
- Variables and Inputs;
- Conditionals, Classes, Functions, Objects, Classes, Inheritance
- Facing direction
- Transitions
- Bounds
- Prefabs
- Collision between game objects


## Setup
- Unity version: 2021.3.16f1
- .NET: 7.0.102

## Play
You can download the game directly from [Itch.io](https://igordiasth.itch.io/junin-ninja).

## Reference
The orignal game is from [Awesome Tuts](https://awesometuts.com/unity?utm_source=yt&utm_medium=vid&utm_campaign=what_to_do_when_you_get_rejected_from_game_studio). I took the idea to replicate my game with the sprites that I found on the Unity website.
